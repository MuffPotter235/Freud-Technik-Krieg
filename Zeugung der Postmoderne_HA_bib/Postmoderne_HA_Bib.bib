  author = {Ignatieff, Michael},
  abstract = {"In 'real' wars, whole nations are mobilised, soldiers fight and die,
	victories are won. In virtual war, hostilities may not even be declared;
	the combatants are strike pilots and computer programmers, the watching
	nation is a television audience and instead of victory there is just
	an uncertain endgame. Kosovo was a virtual war: fought by pilots
	at 15,000 feet, commanded by generals whose only view of the battle
	was through their pilots' bombing sights, reported by opposing media
	with competing versions of the damage; a war in which Americans and
	{NATO} forces did the fighting but only Kosovars and Serbs did the
	dying." "Michael Ignatieff has travelled these battle zones for a
	decade, sending back moving reports and penetrating analysis. Yet
	Kosovo in 1999 moved armed aggression into a new phase, and in Virtual
	War he examines this strange, remote type of warfare through the
	eyes of the key players - the roving diplomat Richard Holbrooke,
	General Wesley Clark and Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the war
	crimes tribunal - and of the people who suffered."--{BOOK} {JACKET}.},
